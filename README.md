# About

I made this tool for personal use, but now I'm releasing it under MIT license. You can learn more about this project by watching the videos I made while working on it.

# Disclaimer

I'm releasing this tool as it is cause I don't have time right now to work on it. There's still a lot of things that I would love to implement and improve, but that will have to wait.
